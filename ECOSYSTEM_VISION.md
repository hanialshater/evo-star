### Communication Flow

1. **Research → Memory**: New patterns and techniques discovered
2. **Memory → evo-star**: Historical patterns guide population evolution
3. **evo-star → evo-agent**: Promising candidates sent for refinement
4. **evo-agent → Memory**: Successful refinement strategies stored
5. **Memory → evo-agent**: Relevant patterns and context provided
6. **evo-agent → evo-star**: Refined candidates returned to population

### Example Workflow

1. **evo-research** discovers a new algorithmic pattern from recent papers
2. **evo-memory** stores and indexes the pattern with semantic embeddings
3. **evo-star** initiates population evolution using historical successful strategies
4. When a promising candidate emerges, **evo-star** delegates to **evo-agent**
5. **evo-agent** performs deep analysis and refinement using relevant tools
6. **evo-memory** captures the successful refinement process and patterns
7. Refined candidate returns to **evo-star** population for further evolution
8. Cycle continues with accumulated knowledge and improved strategies
